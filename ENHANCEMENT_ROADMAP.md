# Enhancement Roadmap

## Immediate (While Waiting for APIs)

### 1. Improve AI Inference for Barcode Analysis
- **Goal**: Better region detection and product type inference
- **Benefit**: Higher success rate for unknown barcodes
- **Implementation**: Enhanced pattern recognition and machine learning

### 2. Expand Ownership Mappings Database
- **Goal**: Add more pre-researched brand ownership data
- **Benefit**: Faster results for known brands
- **Implementation**: Manual research and data entry

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Goal**: Better progress tracking and result visualization
- **Benefit**: Users understand what's happening during lookup
- **Implementation**: Improved UI components and real-time updates

### 4. Caching and Performance
- **Goal**: Faster repeated lookups
- **Benefit**: Reduced API calls and better user experience
- **Implementation**: Redis or database caching layer

## Short Term (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Multi-Agent Collaboration System
- **Goal**: Multiple AI agents working together
- **Benefit**: More comprehensive research and higher accuracy
- **Implementation**: Agent orchestration and result synthesis

### 2. Advanced Confidence Estimation
- **Goal**: More sophisticated confidence scoring
- **Benefit**: Better decision making for fallback strategies
- **Implementation**: Multi-factor analysis and machine learning

### 3. Evaluation Framework
- **Goal**: Measure and improve system performance
- **Benefit**: Data-driven improvements
- **Implementation**: Automated testing and metrics collection

## Medium Term (1-2 months)

### 1. RAG Knowledge Base Integration
- **Goal**: Learn from previous research
- **Benefit**: System improves over time
- **Implementation**: Vector database and semantic search

### 2. User Contribution System
- **Goal**: Crowdsource ownership data
- **Benefit**: Expand database with community input
- **Implementation**: Verification system and quality control

### 3. API Rate Limiting and Optimization
- **Goal**: Efficient use of paid APIs
- **Benefit**: Cost optimization and better performance
- **Implementation**: Smart caching and request batching

## Long Term (3+ months)

### 1. Machine Learning Model Training
- **Goal**: Custom models for ownership prediction
- **Benefit**: Higher accuracy and faster results
- **Implementation**: Training on historical data

### 2. Multi-Language Support
- **Goal**: Support for international products
- **Benefit**: Global market coverage
- **Implementation**: Translation and localization

### 3. Mobile App Development
- **Goal**: Native mobile experience
- **Benefit**: Better barcode scanning and offline support
- **Implementation**: React Native or native development

## Current Priority Order

1. **SerpAPI Integration** (this week)
2. **Enhanced AI Inference** (next week)
3. **Ownership Database Expansion** (ongoing)
4. **Multi-Agent System** (when APIs are ready)
5. **Evaluation Framework** (continuous improvement)

## Success Metrics

- **Lookup Success Rate**: Target 80%+ (currently ~60%)
- **Average Response Time**: Target <5 seconds (currently ~8 seconds)
- **User Satisfaction**: Measured through feedback
- **Cost per Lookup**: Target <$0.10 (currently ~$0.15)

## Next Immediate Action

Once SerpAPI is set up, we should focus on:
1. Testing the enhanced pipeline
2. Expanding the ownership mappings database
3. Improving the AI inference algorithms
4. Setting up the evaluation framework
