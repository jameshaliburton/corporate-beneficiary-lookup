# Enhanced Gemini Verification - Deployment Checklist

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Set `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH=true` in production environment
- [ ] Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is configured
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ENABLED=true` for admin access (optional)
- [ ] Confirm `NODE_ENV=production`

### 2. Code Verification
- [ ] All files committed to git
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 3. Database Schema
- [ ] No new database fields required
- [ ] Existing `agent_results` structure supports new fields
- [ ] No migrations needed

## üîß Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Code Changes
```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Enhanced Gemini verification with admin debug tools"

# Deploy to production
git push origin main
# or your deployment command
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
In your production environment (Vercel/Netlify/etc.):
```bash
GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ENABLED=true  # Optional, for admin access
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Test a brand scan with enhanced verification
2. Check that explanations appear in `agent_results.gemini_analysis`
3. Verify admin view works at `/admin/gemini-verification/[brand]`
4. Confirm debug tools show prompt and raw output

## üß™ Testing in Production

### Test Brands
1. **Puma** - Should show all requirements confirmed
2. **Nespresso** - Should show most confirmed, family control not found
3. **Watkins** - Should show mixed evidence quality

### Test URLs
- `https://yourdomain.com/admin/gemini-verification/puma`
- `https://yourdomain.com/admin/gemini-verification/nespresso`
- `https://yourdomain.com/admin/gemini-verification/watkins`

### Verification Points
- [ ] Enhanced explanations appear in admin view
- [ ] Status chips show correct colors
- [ ] Evidence quality scores display (1-5)
- [ ] Prompt and raw output sections work
- [ ] Copy buttons function correctly
- [ ] Debug link appears in result page (dev only)

## üîç Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Verification Success Rate**: Should remain stable or improve
2. **Response Times**: Monitor for any performance impact
3. **Error Rates**: Check for parsing or API errors
4. **Admin Usage**: Monitor debug tool usage

### Log Patterns to Monitor
- `[GEMINI_VERIFICATION]` - Enhanced verification logs
- `[GEMINI_VERIFICATION] Enhanced explanations extracted` - Success logs
- `[GEMINI_VERIFICATION] Raw Gemini input/output` - Debug logs

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Set `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH=false`
2. Redeploy to disable enhanced features
3. System will fall back to original behavior
4. No data loss or corruption

## üìä Post-Deployment

### Immediate (0-24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check verification success rates
- [ ] Verify admin tools work
- [ ] Test with multiple brands

### Short-term (1-7 days)
- [ ] Analyze explanation quality
- [ ] Monitor user feedback
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Review debug tool usage

### Long-term (1-4 weeks)
- [ ] Optimize prompts based on data
- [ ] Improve evidence quality scoring
- [ ] Add additional verification requirements
- [ ] Enhance admin tools based on usage

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:
1. Enhanced verification works for all test brands
2. Admin debug tools display correctly
3. No increase in error rates
4. Verification explanations provide value
5. System performance remains stable

## üÜò Support

If issues occur:
1. Check environment variables
2. Review logs for error patterns
3. Test with `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH=false` to isolate
4. Use admin debug tools to investigate specific cases
