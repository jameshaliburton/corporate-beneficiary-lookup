**Files Created**:
- `audit-indexes.js`
- `optimize-indexes.sql`

**Impact**: Improves database query performance and ensures optimal index coverage for critical operations.

### 6. üß™ Run Production-Safe Test Suite
**Commit**: `test: production-safe verification of ownership pipeline v1.1 (ownership-por-v1.1)`

**Changes Made**:

**Impact**: Provides comprehensive validation of the ownership pipeline with detailed test reporting.

### 7. üëÄ Optional: Light Trace Debug View
**Commit**: `feat: add trace debug page for internal QA (ownership-por-v1.1)`

**Changes Made**:
- Created hidden trace debug page accessible only in dev or via secret URL
- Implemented API endpoint for trace data retrieval
- Added security controls for production access
- Included comprehensive trace data display with expandable sections
- Added mock trace data support for testing

**Files Created**:
- `src/app/trace-debug/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/trace-debug/[id]/route.ts`

**Impact**: Provides internal QA team with detailed trace visibility for debugging and validation.

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Cache System Enhancements

3. **Testing**: Run `test-ownership-por-v1.1.js` to validate the implementation
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor cache hit rates and verification performance
5. **RAG Population**: Monitor knowledge base growth and query performance

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the following rollback steps are available:

1. **Cache Logic**: Revert to previous cache key generation
2. **Gemini Logic**: Revert to previous verification triggers
3. **RAG Population**: Disable RAG population agent
4. **Indexes**: Remove new indexes if they cause issues
5. **Trace Debug**: Remove trace debug routes

## üìà Success Metrics
