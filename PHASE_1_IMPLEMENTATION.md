# Phase 1 Implementation: Incremental Prompt Versioning

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of Phase 1 from our updated plan. We're focusing on incremental prompt versioning and leveraging the existing trace structure.

## Current Status
- âœ… Environment: Working on Vercel (avoiding local environment issues)
- âœ… Foundation: Basic prompt registry system created
- ðŸ”„ Next: Implement prompt versioning in ownership research agent

## Step 1: Complete Prompt Registry System

### 1.1 Update prompt-registry.js with full implementation
- [ ] Add complete prompt registry with version management
- [ ] Implement prompt builder functions for v1.0 and v1.1
- [ ] Add A/B testing framework foundation
- [ ] Test on Vercel

### 1.2 Create prompt version tracking
- [ ] Add database table for prompt version tracking
- [ ] Implement prompt version logging
- [ ] Add prompt performance metrics

## Step 2: Integrate Prompt Versioning into Ownership Research Agent

### 2.1 Modify ownership-research-agent.js
- [ ] Import prompt registry
- [ ] Replace hardcoded prompt with versioned prompt system
- [ ] Add prompt version to execution trace
- [ ] Test on Vercel

### 2.2 Add prompt version selection logic
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for prompt versions
- [ ] Add prompt version to result logging
- [ ] Create prompt comparison metrics

## Step 3: Enhanced Trace Structure

### 3.1 Leverage existing agent_execution_trace
- [ ] Add prompt version to trace structure
- [ ] Enhance step-level logging
- [ ] Add confidence tracking throughout pipeline
- [ ] Implement error categorization

### 3.2 Improve trace data quality
- [ ] Add detailed reasoning at each step
- [ ] Track source quality scores
- [ ] Log confidence calibration data
- [ ] Add performance timing data

## Step 4: A/B Testing Framework

### 4.1 Basic A/B testing implementation
- [ ] Create A/B test configuration
- [ ] Implement random prompt version selection
- [ ] Add test group tracking
- [ ] Create performance comparison logic

### 4.2 Metrics collection
- [ ] Track accuracy by prompt version
- [ ] Monitor confidence score accuracy
- [ ] Compare response times
- [ ] Analyze error rates

## Step 5: Evaluation Dashboard Enhancement

### 5.1 Add prompt version metrics to dashboard
- [ ] Display prompt version performance
- [ ] Show A/B test results
- [ ] Add prompt comparison charts
- [ ] Create prompt version selector

### 5.2 Real-time monitoring
- [ ] Live prompt performance tracking
- [ ] Alert system for performance degradation
- [ ] Prompt version rollback capability
- [ ] Performance trend analysis

## Implementation Order

### Week 1: Foundation (Current)
1. âœ… Create prompt registry foundation
2. [ ] Complete prompt registry implementation
3. [ ] Test basic functionality on Vercel

### Week 2: Integration
1. [ ] Integrate prompt versioning into ownership research agent
2. [ ] Add prompt version to execution traces
3. [ ] Test integration on Vercel

### Week 3: A/B Testing
1. [ ] Implement basic A/B testing framework
2. [ ] Add metrics collection
3. [ ] Test A/B testing on Vercel

### Week 4: Dashboard Enhancement
1. [ ] Add prompt version metrics to dashboard
2. [ ] Create comparison tools
3. [ ] Test dashboard enhancements on Vercel

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 100% of agent executions use versioned prompts
- [ ] A/B testing framework operational
- [ ] Prompt performance metrics collected
- [ ] Dashboard shows prompt version comparisons

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] Measurable improvement in confidence accuracy
- [ ] Reduced JSON parsing errors
- [ ] Better source utilization
- [ ] Improved reasoning quality

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- [ ] Quick reversion to previous prompt versions
- [ ] Performance degradation alerts
- [ ] Automatic fallback to stable versions
- [ ] Manual override capabilities

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test all changes on Vercel first
- [ ] Gradual rollout of new prompt versions
- [ ] Monitor performance closely
- [ ] Have rollback procedures ready

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete prompt registry implementation
2. **This Week**: Integrate into ownership research agent
3. **Next Week**: Implement A/B testing framework
4. **Following Week**: Enhance dashboard with prompt metrics

## Notes

- Avoiding local environment issues by working directly on Vercel
- Focusing on incremental improvements rather than major changes
- Leveraging existing trace structure for enhanced logging
- Prioritizing stability and rollback capabilities
