## 📋 Implementation Log

### Task 1: Disambiguation Agent Fix
- **Started**: 2025-08-29T10:20:00.000Z
- **Status**: In Progress - Execution Flow Debug
- **Approach**: 
  1. First, add comprehensive logging to understand why disambiguation isn't triggering
  2. Investigate trigger conditions and confidence thresholds
  3. Test with specific ambiguous cases
  4. Implement fix with feature flag protection
- **Tests Added**: `tests/e2e/test-disambiguation-trigger.ts` (5 test cases)
- **Logs Added**: Debug logging in `LLMResearchAgent` and `enhanced-ownership-research-agent.js`
- **Reports Updated**: Multiple verification reports generated

## 🔍 Disambiguation Agent – Execution Flow Debug

### Debug Steps Completed
1. **Added disambiguation logic** to both `LLMResearchAgent` and `enhanced-ownership-research-agent.js`
2. **Created comprehensive test suite** with 5 disambiguation test cases
3. **Added prominent debug logging** with 🚨 emojis to track execution
4. **Ran multiple API tests** to verify disambiguation triggering

### Evidence Collected
- **Missing Debug Logs**: Prominent `🚨🚨🚨` debug logs not appearing in API responses
- **API Response Fields**: 
  - `"disambiguation_triggered": false` (expected: true for ambiguous brands)
  - `"disambiguation_options": []` (expected: populated array)
  - `"research_method": "llm_first_research"` (confirms LLMResearchAgent is called)
- **Test Results**: 0/5 disambiguation tests passing (Jordan, Samsung, Nestlé™ not triggering)

### Current Hypotheses
1. **Early Return Condition**: `checkDisambiguationNeeds()` function may be after an early return statement
2. **Execution Flow Issue**: LLM research might be taking a different code path that bypasses disambiguation check
3. **Silent Error**: An error might be occurring before disambiguation check, causing early return
4. **Function Placement**: Disambiguation logic might be in unreachable code path

### Next Steps
1. **Inspect all return statements** above `checkDisambiguationNeeds()` call
2. **Add numbered logging** before/after each return condition
3. **Confirm function placement** in reachable execution path
4. **Wrap in try/catch** to prevent silent failures
5. **Test ambiguous brands** after logic fix

### 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY - LLMResearchAgent NOT BEING CALLED
**Evidence**: Even with the most prominent debug log (`🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 LLMResearchAgent FUNCTION ENTRY POINT REACHED 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨`), no debug logs appear in API responses.

**Root Cause**: The `enhanced-ownership-research-agent.js` is calling a **different function** that returns `"research_method": "llm_first_research"` but it's NOT the `LLMResearchAgent` I've been modifying.

**Next Action**: Find the actual function being called in the enhanced agent that's generating the LLM research results.
