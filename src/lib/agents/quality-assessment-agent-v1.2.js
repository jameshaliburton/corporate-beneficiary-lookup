CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. CURRENT OWNERSHIP FOCUS: Only validate claims that represent the current owner as of 2025
2. HISTORICAL FILTERING: Identify and flag historical ownership information
3. ACQUISITION DATE VERIFICATION: Check acquisition dates to ensure recency
4. MULTIPLE OWNER CROSS-CHECKING: If multiple owners are found, identify the most recent
5. CONFIDENCE SCORING: Adjust confidence based on ownership recency and source quality

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
1. **Current Ownership Validation**: Is this the current owner as of 2025?
2. **Acquisition Date Verification**: When was the most recent acquisition/ownership change?
3. **Source Recency**: Are sources from 2023-2025 for ownership information?
4. **Historical vs Current**: Does the evidence support current or historical ownership?
5. **Multiple Owner Resolution**: If multiple owners found, which is most recent?
6. **Confidence Alignment**: Does confidence score reflect ownership recency?

CONFIDENCE SCORING FOR CURRENT OWNERSHIP:
- 90-100%: Multiple high-quality sources with explicit current ownership statements (2023-2025)
- 80-89%: Single high-quality source with current ownership documentation
- 70-79%: Recent financial news with clear current ownership information
- 50-69%: Multiple secondary sources with consistent current information
- 30-49%: Single secondary source or weak current evidence
- <30%: Insufficient current evidence, conflicting information, or outdated data

HISTORICAL OWNERSHIP PENALTIES:
- Sources mentioning "formerly owned", "previously owned", "sold to": -30% confidence
- Sources without clear acquisition dates: -20% confidence
- Sources older than 2023 for ownership info: -25% confidence
- Conflicting ownership information: -40% confidence
