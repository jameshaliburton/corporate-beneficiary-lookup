KEY REQUIREMENTS:
- Always highlight the country of the ultimate financial beneficiary (this is crucial)
- Make content engaging and shareable (TikTok/Gen Z friendly)
- Be factual and credible, never invent information
- Use emoji flags (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, etc.) to highlight countries
- Keep headlines under 10 words, taglines under 15 words
- Stories should be 1-2 sentences, engaging but informative
- Always provide fallback content if data is missing

OUTPUT FORMAT (respond with valid JSON only):
{
  "headline": "Your engaging headline here",
  "tagline": "Your descriptive tagline here", 
  "story": "Your engaging story here",
  "ownership_notes": ["Note 1", "Note 2"],

BRAND COUNTRY: ${result.brand_country || 'Unknown'}

OWNER COUNTRY: ${result.ultimate_owner_country || result.financial_beneficiary_country || 'Unknown'}
CONFIDENCE: ${result.confidence || 0}%
OWNERSHIP TYPE: ${result.ownership_type || 'Unknown'}
${result.acquisition_year ? `ACQUISITION YEAR: ${result.acquisition_year}` : ''}

${result.vision_context ? `VISION CONTEXT: Product analysis provided additional context` : ''}
${result.disambiguation_options?.length ? `DISAMBIGUATION: Multiple ownership options found` : ''}

EXAMPLES OF GOOD CONTENT:

Example 1 - Hidden Global Owner:
- headline: "Ben & Jerry's isn't as American as you think ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±"
- tagline: "Owned by Unilever in Netherlands"
- story: "Despite its Vermont roots and American branding, Ben & Jerry's is actually owned by Dutch-British conglomerate Unilever, which acquired it in 2000."

Example 2 - Local Independent:
- headline: "IKEA stays true to Swedish roots ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª"
- tagline: "Family-owned company in Sweden"
- story: "IKEA remains under Swedish ownership through the Kamprad family, maintaining its distinctive Scandinavian design philosophy."

Example 3 - Acquisition Story:
- headline: "WhatsApp's $19B journey to Meta ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
- tagline: "Acquired by Meta in 2014"
- story: "WhatsApp went from a small startup to a $19 billion acquisition by Facebook (now Meta) in 2014, becoming part of the social media giant's ecosystem."

Example 4 - Low Confidence:
- headline: "Limited info on this brand's ownership"
- tagline: "More research needed (${result.confidence || 0}% confidence)"
- story: "We found some information about this brand's ownership, but our confidence is limited. Additional research would help clarify the ownership structure."

Example 5 - Ambiguous:
- headline: "Complex ownership structure detected"
- tagline: "Multiple possible owners identified"
- story: "This brand appears to have a complex ownership structure with multiple possible parent companies. Further investigation is needed to determine the ultimate owner."

Create content that:
1. Emphasizes the country of the ultimate owner (use flag emojis)
2. Is engaging and shareable
3. Matches the tone of the examples above
4. Handles missing data gracefully
5. Is factually accurate based on the provided data
