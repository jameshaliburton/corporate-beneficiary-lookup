The INGKA Foundation is the largest owner of IKEA stores worldwide and is effectively the ultimate financial beneficiary of most IKEA retail operations. This structure is well-documented in corporate filings and has been extensively reported by financial media. The INGKA Foundation's charitable status and Dutch registration have been consistent features of IKEA's corporate structure for decades, making this analysis highly reliable.",

While it was historically owned by Unilever, in 2021 Unilever announced the creation of ekaterra, a separate tea division that included Lipton. In 2022, Unilever sold ekaterra (including Lipton) to CVC Capital Partners for €4.5 billion. However, this primarily affects the hot tea business. The Lipton ready-to-drink tea business remains operated as a joint venture between Unilever and PepsiCo in most markets. The ownership structure is complex because it varies by product type and market. For ready-to-drink products, Pepsi Lipton International (PLI) is the joint venture between PepsiCo and Unilever that manages the brand. For hot tea products, CVC Capital Partners is now the owner through ekaterra. This analysis focuses on the hot tea business ownership, as it represents the primary Lipton brand.",

                      "reasoning": "Lipton has an interesting recent ownership history. While it was historically owned by Unilever, in 2021 Unilever separated its tea business into a new division called ekaterra, which included Lipton. In 2022, Unilever sold ekaterra (including Lipton) to CVC Capital Partners for €4.5 billion. However, this primarily affects the hot tea business. The Lipton ready-to-drink tea business remains operated as a joint venture between Unilever and PepsiCo in most markets. The ownership structure is complex because it varies by product type and market. For bottled/ready-to-drink Lipton products, the financial beneficiary is split between Unilever and PepsiCo through their joint venture, while for hot tea products, the ultimate owner is now CVC Capital Partners through their acquisition of ekaterra. Given the question doesn't specify product type, I've focused on the hot tea business which represents the original and primary Lipton brand.",
