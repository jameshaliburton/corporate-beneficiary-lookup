The joint venture was established in 1991 to leverage PepsiCo's distribution network and beverage expertise while utilizing Unilever's brand and tea expertise. For ready-to-drink products like Lipton Ice Tea, profits are shared between PepsiCo and Unilever through the joint venture, but Unilever maintains ownership of the core brand and receives royalties. This structure is well-documented and has been stable for many years, making this analysis highly confident. The ultimate financial beneficiary is Unilever PLC, as they own the brand itself and receive both joint venture profits and brand royalties.",
