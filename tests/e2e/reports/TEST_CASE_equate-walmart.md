This is a straightforward ownership case as Equate was created by Walmart as their in-house brand and has been since its inception. The brand is not licensed or operated through any intermediate companies - it's directly owned and controlled by Walmart Inc. While the products may be manufactured by various contract manufacturers, the brand and its intellectual property are wholly owned by Walmart. This can be verified through Walmart's corporate documentation, trademark registrations, and the fact that Equate products are exclusively sold through Walmart's retail channels. The ownership structure is very clear and well-documented, hence the 100% confidence score.",
