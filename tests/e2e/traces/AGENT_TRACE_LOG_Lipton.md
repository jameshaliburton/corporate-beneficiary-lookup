This joint venture was established in 1991 and continues to operate globally. While PepsiCo handles the distribution network, Unilever owns the Lipton brand itself and is the primary financial beneficiary of the brand's success. In 2020, Unilever unified its dual-headed structure into a single parent company, Unilever PLC, headquartered in the United Kingdom. The high confidence score is based on well-documented corporate structures and long-standing business relationships between these companies. The Lipton brand was originally created by Thomas Lipton in 1890 and was acquired by Unilever in 1938, and this ownership has remained constant despite various distribution and manufacturing partnerships.",
