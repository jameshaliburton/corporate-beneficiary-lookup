              "reasoning": "IKEA has a complex ownership structure deliberately designed for tax efficiency and control. The IKEA brand and concept is owned by Inter IKEA Systems B.V., which is the worldwide IKEA franchisor. However, most IKEA stores are operated by INGKA Group (formerly IKEA Group), which is controlled by the INGKA Foundation, a Dutch-registered entity established by IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad. The INGKA Foundation is the largest owner of IKEA stores worldwide and is the ultimate financial beneficiary of most IKEA retail operations, including the sale of products like the Billy Bookcase. This structure has been well-documented in corporate filings and investigative reporting. The high confidence score reflects the extensive public documentation of this ownership structure, though its complexity makes it challenging to track all financial flows with absolute certainty.",
