While Nike is indeed a major global brand, I'm not confident that Nike produces lip gloss as part of their core product offerings. Nike primarily focuses on athletic footwear, apparel, and sports equipment. If there is a Nike-branded lip gloss, it would likely be either: 1) A licensed product produced by a beauty company under Nike's brand, 2) A misattribution, or 3) A very niche or discontinued product. Without more specific product information or a barcode, I cannot verify the actual manufacturer of this lip gloss product. While NIKE, Inc. is definitely the parent company of the Nike brand, the actual financial beneficiary of this specific product might be different if it's a licensed product. The ownership structure provided reflects Nike's corporate structure, but may not accurately represent the specific lip gloss product's ownership.",
