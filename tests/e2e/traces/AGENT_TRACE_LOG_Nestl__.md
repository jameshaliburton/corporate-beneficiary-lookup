Nestl√© S.A. is a publicly traded company headquartered in Vevey, Switzerland, and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Nescaf√© was developed by Nestl√©'s own scientists and has remained a core brand throughout its history. The ownership is direct and clear, with no intermediate holding companies or complex ownership structures between the brand and the parent company. The brand is so integral to Nestl√© that it represents one of the company's most valuable assets and is used globally. The confidence score is 100 because this is one of the most straightforward and well-documented cases of brand ownership in the corporate world, with the relationship between Nescaf√© and Nestl√© being both historical and fundamental to the company's identity.",
