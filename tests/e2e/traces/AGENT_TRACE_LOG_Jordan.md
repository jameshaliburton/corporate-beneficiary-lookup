The brand was acquired by Colgate-Palmolive in 2004 as part of their global oral care expansion strategy. Jordan is particularly strong in Scandinavian markets and is known for its toothbrushes and other oral care products. Colgate-Palmolive is a publicly traded company (NYSE: CL) headquartered in New York, USA, and has maintained ownership of the Jordan brand since the acquisition. The high confidence score is based on the well-documented acquisition and Colgate-Palmolive's continued operation of the brand as part of their oral care portfolio. The ownership structure is straightforward with Jordan operating as a brand within Colgate-Palmolive's global operations.",
