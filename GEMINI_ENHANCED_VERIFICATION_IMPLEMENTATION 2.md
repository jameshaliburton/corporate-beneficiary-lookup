# Enhanced Gemini Verification Implementation

## Overview

This implementation enhances the Gemini verification system to provide better explanations and more robust evidence matching for brand ownership claims. The enhancements are gated behind the `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH` feature flag to ensure backward compatibility.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
- **Explicit Verification Requirements**: The prompt now explicitly asks Gemini to verify 5 specific ownership aspects:
  - Ultimate Ownership
  - Family Control
  - Percentage Ownership
  - Corporate Structure
  - Geographic Control

- **Evidence Matching Instructions**: Clear instructions for:
  - Identifying specific snippets that support/contradict claims
  - Explaining WHY evidence supports or contradicts each requirement
  - Rating evidence quality (strong, moderate, weak, insufficient)
  - Noting gaps in evidence

### 2. Structured Explanation Fields
New fields added to `agent_results.gemini_analysis`:
```json
{
  "explanations_by_requirement": {
    "ultimate_ownership": {
      "status": "confirmed|contradicted|mixed_evidence|insufficient_evidence",
      "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why this requirement was verified or not",
      "evidence_quality": "strong|moderate|weak|insufficient",
      "supporting_snippets": ["specific snippet references"],
      "contradicting_snippets": ["specific snippet references"],
      "missing_information": ["what specific information is missing"]
    },
    // ... similar structure for other requirements
  },
  "enhanced_match_enabled": true,
  "verification_requirements_analyzed": ["ultimate_ownership", "family_control", ...]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
- **Input Logging**: Logs the full prompt sent to Gemini
- **Output Logging**: Logs the complete response from Gemini
- **Feature Flag Status**: Logs whether enhanced matching is enabled
- **Explanation Extraction**: Logs successful extraction of enhanced explanations

### 4. Feature Flag Implementation
- **Environment Variable**: `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH=true`
- **Backward Compatibility**: When disabled, uses original prompt and behavior
- **Graceful Fallback**: Enhanced fields are only added when the feature flag is enabled

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/lib/agents/gemini-ownership-analysis-agent.js`**
   - Added `GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH` feature flag
   - Created `buildEnhancedVerificationPrompt()` function
   - Created `buildStandardVerificationPrompt()` function (original behavior)
   - Enhanced result parsing to extract `explanations_by_requirement`
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Updated result structure to include enhanced fields

2. **`src/app/api/lookup/route.ts`**
   - Updated `agent_results.gemini_analysis` structure to include enhanced fields
   - Added conditional inclusion of explanation fields

### Schema Compliance

✅ **No schema changes** to `verification_result` or `verification_evidence`
✅ **No breaking changes** to downstream agent triggers
✅ **No changes** to confidence scoring logic
✅ **All new fields** added inside `agent_results.gemini_analysis` only

## Testing

### Test Files Created

1. **`test-gemini-enhanced-verification.js`**
   - Unit test for Puma brand verification
   - Demonstrates enhanced explanation extraction
   - Shows evidence analysis and confidence assessment

2. **`test-gemini-multi-brand-verification.js`**
   - Comprehensive test for multiple brands:
     - Puma (well-known brand with clear ownership)
     - Nespresso (subsidiary of Nestlé)
     - The Watkins Co. (private company)
     - ObscureBrand (unknown brand for edge case testing)

3. **`test-enhanced-gemini-simple.js`**
   - Simple verification test
   - Quick validation of feature flag functionality

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test single brand (Puma)
node test-gemini-enhanced-verification.js

# Test multiple brands
node test-gemini-multi-brand-verification.js

# Simple verification test
node test-enhanced-gemini-simple.js
```

## Usage

### Enabling Enhanced Verification

Set the environment variable:
```bash
export GEMINI_VERIFICATION_ENHANCED_MATCH=true
```

### Accessing Enhanced Explanations

```javascript
// In your application code
const result = await geminiAgent.analyze(brand, productName, existingResult);

if (result.gemini_analysis?.explanations_by_requirement) {
  const explanations = result.gemini_analysis.explanations_by_requirement;
  
  // Check ultimate ownership verification
  const ultimateOwnership = explanations.ultimate_ownership;
  console.log('Ultimate Ownership Status:', ultimateOwnership.status);
  console.log('Evidence Quality:', ultimateOwnership.evidence_quality);
  console.log('Explanation:', ultimateOwnership.explanation);
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Transparency**: Users can see exactly why verification succeeded or failed
2. **Improved Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps troubleshoot verification issues
3. **Structured Analysis**: Each verification requirement is analyzed separately
4. **Evidence Quality Assessment**: Clear indication of evidence strength
5. **Backward Compatibility**: No impact on existing functionality when disabled

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Verification Requirements**: Could add more specific requirements like:
   - Regulatory compliance
   - Financial performance indicators
   - Market presence verification

2. **Evidence Scoring**: Could implement numerical scoring for evidence quality

3. **Requirement Customization**: Could allow configuration of which requirements to verify

4. **Integration with UI**: Could display enhanced explanations in the user interface

## Monitoring

The implementation includes comprehensive logging to monitor:
- Feature flag usage
- Enhanced explanation extraction success rates
- Evidence quality distribution
- Verification requirement analysis patterns

Look for these log patterns:
- `[GEMINI_VERIFICATION]` - Enhanced verification logs
- `[GEMINI_VERIFICATION] Enhanced explanations extracted` - Successful extraction
- `[GEMINI_VERIFICATION] Raw Gemini input/output` - Debug information
