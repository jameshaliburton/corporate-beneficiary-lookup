# Enhanced Pipeline Refactor Summary

## Overview

The ownership research pipeline has been comprehensively refactored to support intelligent follow-up context processing, enhanced query building, retry logic, disambiguation, and detailed debug logging.

## üéØ Implemented Features

### 1. Follow-Up Context Integration

**‚úÖ Always parse followUpContext via context-parser.js**

- **EnhancedWebSearchOwnershipAgent** now always processes `followUpContext` when provided
- Context is parsed using `parseContextHints()` to extract structured hints
- Hints are merged with existing hints using `mergeContextHints()`
- Enhanced logging shows context processing and hint merging

```javascript
// Always parse follow-up context if provided
let enhancedHints = { ...hints }
let contextUsed = false

if (followUpContext) {
  console.log('[EnhancedWebSearchOwnershipAgent] üîç Processing follow-up context:', followUpContext)
  const contextHints = await parseContextHints(followUpContext, brand, product_name)
  enhancedHints = mergeContextHints(hints, contextHints)
  contextUsed = true
  console.log('[EnhancedWebSearchOwnershipAgent] ‚úÖ Context hints merged:', {
    country: enhancedHints.country_guess || enhancedHints.country_of_origin,
    product_type: enhancedHints.product_type,
    legal_suffixes: enhancedHints.likely_entity_suffixes,
    industry_hints: enhancedHints.industry_hints
  })
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Query Builder Agent

**‚úÖ QueryBuilderAgent uses extracted hints for localized queries**

- **Base Queries**: Standard ownership research queries
- **Localized Queries**: Multi-language support with LLM-generated queries
- **Registry Queries**: Country-specific corporate registry searches (e.g., `site:virk.dk`)
- **Suffix Queries**: Legal entity suffix variations (e.g., `A/S`, `GmbH`, `SARL`)
- **About-Page Queries**: Prioritized About-page searches with registry integration

```javascript
// Enhanced About-page queries with registry integration
if (country === 'Denmark') {
  queries.push({
    query: `"${brand}" about site:virk.dk`,
    purpose: 'find About page in Danish corporate registry',
    priority: 5,
    expected_sources: ['corporate registry', 'official filings']
  })
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Retry Logic

**‚úÖ AgenticWebResearchAgent retries intelligently when 0 valid sources are parsed**

- **Alternate Query Variations**: Tries queries with legal suffix variations
- **JSON Repair**: Uses `json-repair.js` for parsing failures
- **Early Exit**: Stops when 3+ high-confidence sources are found
- **Progressive Research**: Fetches and analyzes sources progressively

```javascript
// Try alternate query variations with legal suffixes
const alternateResults = await tryAlternateQueryVariations(query, brand, hints)
if (alternateResults.results && alternateResults.results.length > 0) {
  validSourcesFound += alternateResults.results.length
  searchResults.push(alternateResults)
  
  if (debugMode) {
    console.log(`[AgenticWebResearchAgent] ‚úÖ Alternate query successful: ${alternateResults.results.length} results found`)
  }
}

// Early exit if we have enough high-quality sources
if (validSourcesFound >= 3) {
  if (debugMode) {
    console.log(`[AgenticWebResearchAgent] üéØ Early exit: Found ${validSourcesFound} valid sources`)
  }
  break
}
```

### 4. Multi-Company Disambiguation

**‚úÖ Return alternatives[] with confidence scores, reasons, and verification status**

- **Alternatives Array**: Contains alternative companies with similar names
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each alternative has a confidence score and reasoning
- **Verification Status**: Overall verification status for the research
- **Disambiguation Notes**: Detailed notes about the disambiguation process

```javascript
// Enhanced output format with alternatives
{
  "ownership_chain": [...],
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "name": "OK Benzin A/S",
      "role": "Alternative Company",
      "country": "Denmark",
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "reason": "Shares 'OK' prefix and is also based in Denmark, but operates in the energy/fuel industry, not food.",
      "sources": [...]
    }
  ],
  "verification_status": "verified",
  "confidence_explanation": "Ownership verified through multiple Tier 1 sources...",
  "disambiguation_notes": "Successfully identified and differentiated 'OK Snacks A/S' (food) from 'OK Benzin A/S' (fuel)..."
}
```

### 5. Context-Driven Re-Research

**‚úÖ Re-run full research when context is added, ignoring cached failures**

- **Cache Override**: When `followUpContext` is provided, research is re-run even if cached result exists
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear indication when research is re-run due to context
- **Progress Tracking**: Context override is tracked in progress updates

```javascript
// Check if followUpContext is provided - if so, re-run research ignoring cache
if (followUpContext) {
  cacheStage.reason(`Found cached result but followUpContext provided: "${followUpContext}" - re-running research with enhanced context`, REASONING_TYPES.INFO)
  cacheStage.decide('Re-run research with context', ['Use cached result'], 'Follow-up context requires fresh research with enhanced queries')
  
  console.log('[EnhancedAgentOwnershipResearch] üîÑ Re-running research due to followUpContext:', followUpContext)
  await emitProgress(queryId, 'cache_check', 'context_override', { 
    cached_result: existingProduct.financial_beneficiary,
    followUpContext 
  })
}
```

### 6. Enhanced Debug Logging

**‚úÖ Debug logging for query execution and source parsing**

- **Query Execution**: Logs which queries were executed and their results
- **Source Parsing**: Tracks which pages were fetched and parsed
- **Context Usage**: Shows when `followUpContext` was used to build queries
- **Retry Logic**: Detailed logging of retry attempts and alternate queries

```javascript
// Enhanced logging patterns
console.log('[EnhancedWebSearchOwnershipAgent] üîç Processing follow-up context:', followUpContext)
console.log('[EnhancedWebSearchOwnershipAgent] ‚úÖ Context hints merged:', enhancedHints)
console.log('[AgenticWebResearchAgent] üîÑ Starting intelligent searches with retry logic...')
console.log('[AgenticWebResearchAgent] üìù Executing query 1/8:', { query: query.query, purpose: query.purpose })
console.log('[AgenticWebResearchAgent] ‚úÖ Query successful: 2 results found')
console.log('[AgenticWebResearchAgent] ‚ö†Ô∏è Query returned no results, trying alternate variations...')
console.log('[AgenticWebResearchAgent] üéØ Early exit: Found 3 valid sources')
console.log('[AgenticWebResearchAgent] üìä Search execution summary:', summary)
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Web Search Ownership Agent

- **Timeout & Retry**: Configurable timeout with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Context Integration**: Always processes `followUpContext` and merges hints
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging of research parameters and progress
- **Graceful Failure**: Returns `null` on timeout/failure for proper fallback

### Agentic Web Research Agent

- **Intelligent Retry**: Retries with alternate queries and JSON repair
- **Cost Management**: Configurable limits for queries and tokens
- **Early Exit**: Stops when sufficient high-confidence sources are found
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced logging when `debugMode: true` is set

- **Registry Integration**: Country-specific corporate registry searches
- **Legal Suffixes**: Automatic generation of legal entity suffix variations
- **About-Page Prioritization**: Enhanced About-page queries with registry integration

### Context Parser Service

- **Structured Extraction**: Extracts country, product type, legal suffixes, and industry hints
- **LLM-Powered**: Uses Claude for intelligent context parsing
- **Fallback Support**: Regex-based fallback if LLM parsing fails
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence scores for extracted hints

### JSON Repair Utility

- **Robust Parsing**: Handles malformed JSON from LLM responses
- **Multiple Strategies**: Trailing commas, unquoted keys, single quotes, etc.
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with repair strategies
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error reporting for debugging
