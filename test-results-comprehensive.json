His goal was to create a refreshing drink that would aid digestion and boost energy. Little did he know that his creation, originally called 'Brad's Drink' and later renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, would evolve into one of the world's most recognized beverage brands. Today, Pepsi stands as a cornerstone brand of PepsiCo Inc., a multinational corporation that has transformed from a simple soft drink company into a global food and beverage powerhouse. Through strategic acquisitions, innovative marketing campaigns, and constant evolution, PepsiCo has built an empire that extends far beyond its namesake cola, encompassing brands like Lay's, Gatorade, and Quaker Oats.",
